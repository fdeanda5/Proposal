    <h1>Class Project Proposal</h1>

    <h2>Product Name: Birdie</h2>

    <h3>Application Overview:</h3>
    <p>
        The game will feature a bird-like character that moves up and down to dodge pipes. The player will control the bird by pressing a key (likely the spacebar or arrow keys) to navigate through an endless pipe-based obstacle course. The game will track the player's score based on how long they survive and how many obstacles they avoid. The score will be displayed in real time.
    </p>

    <h3>Technology Overview:</h3>
    <p>
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will primarily be used to build the game. GitHub will most likely be used for hosting and version control.
